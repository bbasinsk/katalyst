## Coding Instructions:
- Use functional programming principles as much makes sense
- Try to write compact code as much as makes sense
- Types should be designed to include possible states and exclude impossible states
- When refactoring, think about downstream/upstream uses, make continue with changes as needed to prevent breaks
- Instead of writing comments, prefer to write self-documenting and clear code when it makes sense

**Correct me if I'm wrong!!**
